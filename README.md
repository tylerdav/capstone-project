This was my first solo react build. Took just under three weeks to create. My goal was to create an app where users could follow other users and give movie recommendations based on there wastch history.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can run this project using 
 
### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You can use this json database to get started.
If a movie poster no longer works you can just delete the poster all together from the site or use the edit to add a new image address.
